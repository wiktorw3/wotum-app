# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: February 25, 2025**

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Wotum ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our App.

## 2. DATA COLLECTION
### Local Data Storage
User preferences (favorites, theme, language) are stored locally on your device.

### Pseudonymous Analytics
The app collects pseudonymous analytics data, such as search queries, favorites, and notification preferences. These events are tracked to understand overall usage and improve the app experience.

This data does not include personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email, or phone number. The analytics system (e.g. Firebase Analytics) uses pseudonymous device or session identifiers that cannot be linked to a specific individual.


### Public Information
The political data displayed in the App (including politician profiles, voting records, speeches, and party information) is sourced from publicly available government records and the Polish Parliament (Sejm). This information is not owned by us and is presented for informational purposes only.

## 3. HOW WE USE DATA
Data stored on your device is used solely to personalize your in-app experience, such as saving your favorite politicians and viewing preferences.

Since all data is local, we do not have access to any user-specific data or behavior.

## 4. DATA SECURITY
Data stored locally on your device remains under your control.

If you uninstall the App, all locally stored data will be deleted automatically.

## 5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
The App may connect to Firebase to retrieve information about politicians, speeches, and election data, but no personal information is transmitted.

No third-party analytics or tracking tools are used in the App.

## 6. USER RIGHTS
You control all data stored on your device.

To delete your data, simply uninstall the App.

## 7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Our App is not intended for children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. We will notify users of significant changes within the App.
